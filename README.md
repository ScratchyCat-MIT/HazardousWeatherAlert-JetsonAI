# HazardousWeatherAlert-JetsonAI

## About: 
An AI program made on the jetson ai that is designed  to find hostile weather that could damage solar panels and make decisions on weather or not :p, pun intended! , to close a lid that would protect the equipment. This AI was trained using the resnet 18 AI image training model. The datasets used came from Kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jehanbhathena/weather-dataset) and contained 6862 images of weather. The model was trained on 5 (Fog/Smog, Frost, Hail, Lightning, Sandstorm)of these types of weather that could be deemed harmful to solar panel equipment.
